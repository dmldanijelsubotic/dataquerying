## How to Run the Project

### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

A **virtual environment (venv)** keeps your dependencies isolated from your global Python setup.

#### ðŸ§© On macOS / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### ðŸªŸ On Windows (PowerShell):

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

### Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is active, install all required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### .env file

Copy .env.example and populate it accordingly.

### Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Run the Application

Developer server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver --noreload
```

By default, the API will be available at:
